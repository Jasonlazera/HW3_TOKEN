My program works as expected, however I'm not sure how else to do a scrollable
container or incorporate user input for e. Additionally, I thought we were told in class
that our table doesn't have to be a checkerboard pattern, but it is one way to increase
legibility and earn those points. Overall, I did what I could. Thank you for taking the
time to re-grade these.
